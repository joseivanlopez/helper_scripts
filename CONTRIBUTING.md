YaST Contribution Guidelines
============================

YaST is an open source project and as such it welcomes all kinds of
contributions. If you decide to contribute, please follow these guidelines to
ensure the process is effective and pleasant both for you and YaST maintainers.

There are two main forms of contribution: reporting bugs and performing code
changes.

Bug Reports
-----------

If you find a problem, please report it using [GitHub issues](../../issues).
We can't guarantee that every bug will be fixed, but we'll try.

Code Changes
------------

We welcome all kinds of code contributions, from simple bug fixes to significant
refactorings and implementation of new features. However, before making any
non-trivial contribution, get in touch with us first â€” this can prevent wasted
effort on both sides. Also, have a look at our [development
documentation](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST_development).

To send us your code change, use GitHub pull requests. The workflow is as
follows:

  1. Fork the project.

  2. Create a topic branch based on `master`.

  3. Implement your change, including tests (if possible and makes sense).
     Make sure you adhere to the [Ruby style
     guide](https://github.com/SUSE/style-guides/blob/master/Ruby.md) if
     the changed/added script is written in Ruby.

  4. Publish the branch and create a pull request.

  5. YaST developers will review your change and possibly point out issues.
     Adapt the code under their guidance until they are all resolved.

  6. Finally, the pull request will get merged or rejected.

See also [GitHub's guide on
contributing](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

If you want to do multiple unrelated changes, use separate branches and pull
requests.

### Commits

Each commit in the pull request should do only one thing, which is clearly
described by its commit message. Especially avoid mixing formatting changes and
functional changes into one commit. When writing commit messages, adhere to
[widely used
conventions](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

### Branching

Use only the `master` branch in this repository for maintaining the latest
version of the script. If your script is specific to only e.g. SLES12-SP1
then mention it in the script or in the README file.

Additional Information
----------------------

If you have any question, feel free to ask at the [development mailing
list](http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/) or at the
[#yast](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23yast) IRC channel on freenode.
We'll do our best to provide a timely and accurate answer.
