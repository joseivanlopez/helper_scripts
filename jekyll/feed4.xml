<h2>Report of a week of sprint</h2>
<p>TOSprint in Paris has just ended (<a href="https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Paris_Code_Sprint_2016">wiki page</a>).</p>
<p><b>What a week!</b></p>
<p>First of all I want to warmfully thank the sponsors, especially Olivier Courtin from Oslandia for the organization, and Mozilla France for hosting us.</p>
<h3>What is TOSprint?</h3>
<p>Once a year a bunch of hackers from projects under OsGeo umbrella, meet in a face to face sprint.<br />
This year it happenned in Paris with great number of participants (52).</p>
<p>There was globally five big groups, and if each community was running its own schedule,<br />
there was a lot of cross echanges too.</p>
<p><a href="https://flic.kr/p/ErD5E8"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TOSprint_Paris_Mozilla.png" alt="TOSprint Mozilla" width="600" height="187" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11740" srcset="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TOSprint_Paris_Mozilla-300x94.png 300w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TOSprint_Paris_Mozilla.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
<caption>Mateusz Łoskot</caption>
<p></a></p>
<h3>Personal objectives</h3>
<p>My main objective, except being enough luckly to be a sponsor, was to go there and be in direct contact with upstream.</p>
<p>This can help a lot to improve packages, and create new ones.</p>
<p>Moreover, as one of my openSUSE&#8217;s Application:Geo peer maintainer, Angelos Kalkas was also participating, we decided to make somes changes, and improve the situation of the repository.</p>
<p><span id="more-11732"></span></p>
<h3>openSUSE packaging</h3>
<p>We were using a Staging repository to test the global changes to minimize the breakage on the main repo, kinda à la Factory <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about what you will get once the rebuild will finished:<br />
<b>* gdal</b> goes to 2.0.2 which is big jump since version 1.11</p>
<p><b>* postgis</b> got upgrade to 2.2.1 with sfcgal as dependency so 3D operations are avalaible.</p>
<p>I added two interesting extensions for postgresql/postgis database<br />
 <b>&#8211; pgRouting :</b> a long time missing extension in our repository. see <a href="http://pgrouting.org/">pgrouting.org</a><br />
 <b>&#8211; pointcloud :</b> allow you to store and work with pointcloud in postgresql and also contain a postgis extension. see <a href="https://github.com/pgpointcloud/pointcloud">https://github.com/pgpointcloud/pointcloud</a><br />
Both packages are respecting the postgresql/postgis naming scheme: so to install pointcloud on a postgresql94 server you will install postgresql94-pointcloud package.<br />
They are available at least for 13.2, Leap 42.1, Tumbleweed.</p>
<p>A big thanks to Paul Ramsey for his help resolving the issues raised. Especially the advise to stick to -j1 during compilation of postgis <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><b>* PDAL <a href="http://www.pdal.io/">pdal.io</a></b> (with libght) is a point cloud abstraction layer which is under active development and should<br />
in the future replace libLAS once the compatible C interface will be written.<br />
  A big thanks to Howard Butler, for helping to get all packaging issues resolved.</p>
<p><b>* Mapserver :</b> <a href="http://mapserver.org">mapserver.org</a><br />
During the week, mapserver team made impressive changes:<br />
 &#8211; First by closing numerous github issues which didn&#8217;t get updates for a long time.<br />
They run a bot script which automatically close the github issue, and users get a nice message about it.<br />
Perhaps it could inspire us, on how we write closing ticket in bugtriage.<br />

<pre style="background:gray;color:white;font-style:italic">
  This is an automated comment

  This issue has been closed due to lack of activity. This doesn't mean the issue is invalid,
  it simply got no attention within the last year. Please reopen with missing/relevant information
  if still valid.

  Typically, issues fall in this state for one of the following reasons:

      Hard, impossible or not enough information to reproduce
      Missing test case
      Lack of a champion with interest and/or funding to address the issue
</pre>
<p> &#8211; Part of the team took the challenge to update all the tutorial material.<br />
 &#8211; A number of question about the future of mapscript : lacking maintenance resources (humans and or funding)<br />
 &#8211; Bugfix release on thursday night. 6.4.3 and 7.0.1</p>
<p>For openSUSE, I&#8217;ve been discussing a lot with Thomas Bonfort.<br />
The idea would be to be able to propose at least two or more versions that receive security and bug fixes. Actually the 6.4 and the 7.0 branches.<br />
This will allow people to smoothly upgrade their map files, when there&#8217;s breakage or adaptation needed.</p>
<p>I classify this request as a good idea, and started analyzing what we can do. So its actually a work in progress.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing more enthusiastic (for me) than participating to a FLOSS event. If some days are more frustrating than others, the others serve to build this free world we all need.<br />
So I would like to ping your attention : <b> all FLOSS software and communities need your contribution </b>. If you&#8217;re using one of them, become interested in how it is built, organized, start to learn today how to contribute, and enjoy your journey.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to come, especially on the mapserver side, and more and more packages.<br />
Stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know you have missed the usual summary from the YaST trenches. But don&#8217;t panic, here you got it! As usual, we will only cover some highlights, saving you from the gory details of the not so exciting regular bugfixing.</p>
<h3>Package notifications</h3>
<p>libzypp has a nice feature that enables packages to display notifications when they’re installed/upgraded. Zypper takes advantages of this feature and shows that information when a package is installed/upgraded. For example, if you install <code>mariadb</code> package, Zypper will inform you about setting up a database root password and so on.</p>
<p>If you installed any of those packages with YaST, you missed that piece of information… until now! Starting on <code>yast2 3.1.175</code> YaST will show packages notifications.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15836/13257232/e7e23058-da45-11e5-8e7d-b116f47c686c.png" alt="installation-messages-qt" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15836/13257235/ea6ecade-da45-11e5-91ff-579cb257b859.png" alt="installation-messages-ncurses" /></p>
<p>The only exception is when doing a regular installation (or autoinstallation), as we want to show as few dialogs as possible.</p>
<h3>Registration Codes from a USB Stick</h3>
<p>During the installation of a SUSE Linux Enterprise product, you are asked for a registration code. Previously you had to remember it and type it by hand. Now the code can be read from USB storage.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/102056/13245125/4e0bf5de-da0b-11e5-839a-9d8d70052149.png" alt="regcode-from-usb" /><br />
<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/102056/13255345/127cc83c-da46-11e5-97b5-bc6365361cfd.png" alt="regcode-from-usb-extensions" /></p>
<p>Insert a USB stick at installation boot time or at the latest before you proceed from the first installation screen (Language, Keyboard and License Agreement). That stick should contain the registration codes either at <code>/regcodes.txt</code> or at <code>/regcodes.xml</code>. In the registration dialogs, the input fields will be prefilled.</p>
<p>The syntax of the files is as follows. In the file identify the product with the name quoted by <code>zypper search --type product</code> or <code>SUSEConnect --list-extensions</code> (without the /version/architecture part).</p>
<p>regcodes.txt:
<pre>
SLES    cc36aae1
SLED    309105d4

sle-we  5eedd26a
sle-live-patching 8c541494
</pre>
<p>regcodes.xml: (xml wins if both xml and txt are present)
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;profile xmlns="http://www.suse.com/1.0/yast2ns" xmlns:config="http://www.suse.com/1.0/configns"&gt;
  &lt;suse_register&gt;
    &lt;!-- See https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#CreateProfile.Register.Extension --&gt;
    &lt;addons config:type="list"&gt;
      &lt;addon&gt;
        &lt;!-- Name of add-on as listed by "zypper search --type product" --&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;sle-we&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;reg_code&gt;5eedd26a&lt;/reg_code&gt;
      &lt;/addon&gt;
      &lt;addon&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;sle-live-patching&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;reg_code&gt;8c541494&lt;/reg_code&gt;
      &lt;/addon&gt;
      &lt;addon&gt;
        &lt;!-- SLES is not an add-on but listing it here allows for combining
             several base product registration codes in a single file --&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;SLES&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;reg_code&gt;cc36aae1&lt;/reg_code&gt;
      &lt;/addon&gt;
      &lt;addon&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;SLED&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;reg_code&gt;309105d4&lt;/reg_code&gt;
      &lt;/addon&gt;
    &lt;/addons&gt;
  &lt;/suse_register&gt;
&lt;/profile&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>Lot of Btrfs-related improvements in the expert partitioner</h3>
<p>We also invested quite some time improving the support for Btrfs in the expert partitioner. Implementing one requested feature and closing five bugs.</p>
<p>The following animation shows the feature #320296 (user friendly handling of subvolumes) in action, together with the fix to 965279 (Btrfs settings always overridden with default values).</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/subvolumes-opt.gif" alt="subvolumes-opt" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>But we have even more screenshots and animations for the improvements in the expert partitioner. In the description of <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage/pull/190">this pull request</a>, you have screenshots displaying the new dialog that was implemented to fix bug#928641. And in <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage/pull/186">this other pull request</a>, you can see in action the fixes for bug#944252 (snapshots were offered for partitions other than root) and for bug#954691 (fstab options being forgotten for Btrfs partitions).</p>
<h3>Improving testability of the new storage code</h3>
<p>In recent posts, we reported how we are about to refactor the storage subsystem of YaST. The improved partition proposal for installation <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/02/03/highlights-of-development-sprint-14/">presented in the previous summary</a> performs a lot of operations &#8211;  like analyzing what disks are there and what is on each one of them, checking if there already is enough free space and making a best guess on what partitions may be candidates to be removed to make space for a new Linux installation.</p>
<p>If there are many disks with many partitions, this can get complicated really quickly. So we need a reliable way to test it. Thus, we created a testing framework to build fake storage hardware (disks) with fake partitions and file systems. Although it&#8217;s fake hardware (we can&#8217;t create hard disks out of thin air&#8230; yet), it enables us to do unit tests without setting up virtual machines. With those tests we can cover a lot more scenarios that would otherwise be really difficult to test, with one or many disks, with many partitions of different kinds, with a previously existing RAID array or whatever.</p>
<p>One nice thing about the new libstorage is that it operates on &#8220;device graphs&#8221; that can be transformed into the GraphViz format for easy visualization. Here you have a nice diagram generated by libstorage based on some fake hardware created from <a href="https://gist.github.com/ancorgs/014c34c3c74b9949f3a2">this YAML specification</a>.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fake-devicegraphs.png" rel="attachment wp-att-11723"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fake-devicegraphs-300x136.png" alt="fake-devicegraphs" width="300" height="136" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11723" srcset="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fake-devicegraphs-300x136.png 300w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fake-devicegraphs.png 763w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Better handling of wrong registration code for extensions</h3>
<p>We also spent some time improving the usability of the section for registration of extensions and modules. Now if the user selects several modules and the registration of some of them fails, the user will be kindly redirected back to the same dialog but only with inputs for the unregistered ones. From there, they can go back to unselect the failing extensions or retry with different (or even with the same) codes.</p>
<h3>Say goodbye to the &#8220;receive system mail&#8221; checkbox</h3>
<p>As the last step of the improvements done to the user creation dialog (see the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=11673">previous post</a> for more details). We removed the long-ago meaningless checkbox titled &#8220;Receive System Mail&#8221;. That leaded to the removal of quite some code&#8230; and removing code is usually a good thing. <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Many other things</h3>
<p>As usual, this is just a short summary with some highlights. Many other stuff was implemented and several other bugs were fixed but, you know, we cannot blog about everything if we want to invest some time in debugging and coding. <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>See you in the highlights for next sprint, in around three weeks.</p>
<p>PS.- If you want to be part of the fun, take a look to the YaST-related summer projects we have on the <a href="http://101.opensuse.org/">openSUSE mentoring page</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another three weeks period and another report from the YaST Team (if you don&#8217;t know what we are talking about, see <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/01/07/highlights-of-development-sprint-13/">highlights of sprint 13</a> and the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2015/12/15/lets-blog-about-yast/">presentation post</a>). This was actually a very productive sprint although, as usual, not all changes have such an obvious impact on final users, at least in the short term.</p>
<h3>Redesign and refactoring of the user creation dialog</h3>
<p>One of the most visible changes, at least during the installation process, is the revamped dialog for creating local users. There is a full screenshots-packed description of the original problems (at usability and code levels) and the implemented solution in the <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-users/pull/84">description of this pull request</a> at Github.com.</p>
<p>Spoilers: the new dialog looks like the screenshot below and the openSUSE community now needs to decide the default behavior we want for Tumbleweed regarding password encryption methods. To take part in that discussion, read the mentioned description and reply to <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-01/msg00496.html">this thread</a> in the openSUSE Factory mailing list.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/b12a8f90-c51b-11e5-9ceb-659b6c77bac4.png" rel="attachment wp-att-11675"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/b12a8f90-c51b-11e5-9ceb-659b6c77bac4-300x225.png" alt="b12a8f90-c51b-11e5-9ceb-659b6c77bac4" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11675" srcset="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/b12a8f90-c51b-11e5-9ceb-659b6c77bac4-300x225.png 300w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/b12a8f90-c51b-11e5-9ceb-659b6c77bac4-768x576.png 768w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/b12a8f90-c51b-11e5-9ceb-659b6c77bac4.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond the obvious changes for the final user, the implementation of the new dialogs resulted in a much cleaner and more tested code base, including a new <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-yast2/UI/InstallationDialog">reusable class</a> to greatly streamline the development of new installation dialogs in the future.</p>
<h3>One step further in the new libstorage: installation proposal</h3>
<p>In the highlights of the previous sprint, we already explained the YaST team is putting a lot of effort in rewriting the layer that access to disks, partitions, volumes and all that. One important milestone in such rewrite is the ability to examine a hard disk with a complex partitioning schema (including MS Windows partitions, a Linux installation and so on) and propose the operations that need to be performed in order to install (open)SUSE. It&#8217;s a more complex topic that it could look at the first glance.</p>
<p>During this sprint we created a command line tool that can perform that task. Is still not part of the installation process and will take quite some time until it gets there, but it&#8217;s already a nice showcase of the capabilities of the new library.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/new-storage-proposal-2016-01-27-1900-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-11682"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/new-storage-proposal-2016-01-27-1900-1.png" alt="new-storage-proposal-2016-01-27-1900" width="738" height="636" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11682" srcset="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/new-storage-proposal-2016-01-27-1900-1-300x259.png 300w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/new-storage-proposal-2016-01-27-1900-1.png 738w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /></a><br />
</p>
<h3>Fixed a crash when EULA download fails</h3>
<p>If a download error occurred during the installation of any module or extension requiring an EULA, YaST simply exited after displaying a pop-up error, as you can see here.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/0c444926-bb75-11e5-8e6e-029d018c14d3.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-11684"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/0c444926-bb75-11e5-8e6e-029d018c14d3.gif" alt="0c444926-bb75-11e5-8e6e-029d018c14d3" width="700" height="616" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11684" /></a></p>
<p>Now the workflow goes back to the extension selection, to retry or to deselect the problematic extension. Just like this.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/46fb22a6-bb75-11e5-9830-aff1d516e77e.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-11686"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/46fb22a6-bb75-11e5-9830-aff1d516e77e.gif" alt="46fb22a6-bb75-11e5-9830-aff1d516e77e" width="702" height="623" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11686" /></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Continuous integration for Snapper and (the current) libstorage</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper">Snapper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage/">libstorage</a> now build the Git “master” branch continuously on <a href="http://ci.opensuse.org">ci.opensuse.org</a> (<a href="https://ci.opensuse.org/job/snapper-master/">S</a>, <a href="https://ci.opensuse.org/job/libstorage-master/">L</a>), and commit a passing build to the OBS development project (<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/YaST:Head/snapper">S</a>, <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/YaST:Head/libstorage">L</a>), and if the version number has changed, submit the package to Factory (<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/snapper">S</a>, <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/libstorage">L</a>).</p>
<p>The same set-up works on <a href="http://ci.suse.de">ci.suse.de</a> (<a href="https://ci.suse.de/job/snapper-master/">S</a>, <a href="https://ci.suse.de/job/libstorage-master/">L</a>), committing to the SUSE&#8217;s internal OBS instance (<a href="https://build.suse.de/package/show/Devel:YaST:Head/snapper">S</a>, <a href="https://build.suse.de/package/show/Devel:YaST:Head/libstorage">L</a>) and submitting to the future SLE12-SP2 (<a href="https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:GA/snapper">S</a>, <a href="https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:GA/libstorage">L</a>).</p>
<p>This brings these two packages up to the level of automation that the YaST team uses for the yast2-* packages, and allows releasing simple fixes even by team members who do not work on these packages regularly.</p>
<h3>Disk usage stats in installation and software manager: do not list subvolumes</h3>
<p>While installing software, YaST provides a visual overview of the free space in the different mount points of the system. With Btrfs and its subvolumes feature, the separation between a physical disk and its mount point is not that clear anymore. That resulted in wrong reports in YaST, like the one displayed in the left bottom corner of this screen.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/broken-disk-usage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-11695"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/broken-disk-usage.png" alt="broken-disk-usage" width="681" height="468" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11695" srcset="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/broken-disk-usage-300x206.png 300w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/broken-disk-usage.png 681w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></a></p>
<p>The actual calculation of free space is performed by libzypp (the Zypper library), YaST only takes care of rendering the result of that calculation in the screen. Thus, we closely collaborated with the Zypper developer, Michael Andres, to teach libzypp how to deal with Btrfs subvolumes. Thanks to his work, with any version of libzypp &gt;= 15.21 (already available in Tumbleweed), you can enjoy an error-free disk usage report.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fixed-disk-usage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-11696"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fixed-disk-usage.png" alt="fixed-disk-usage" width="681" height="468" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11696" srcset="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fixed-disk-usage-300x206.png 300w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fixed-disk-usage.png 681w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></a></p>
<p>To ensure we have no regressions, the YaST team also contributed a new test to openQA. See it <a href="https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/117876/modules/yast2_i/steps/7">in action</a>.</p>
<h3>Cleanup dependencies in YaST systemd services</h3>
<p>We have received several bug reports about problems executing AutoYaST or YasT2-Firstboot in combination with complex network settings or third party services&#8230; and even in some simple scenarios. Many of these problems boil down to a single culprit &#8211; the dependencies of the YaST related systemd units.</p>
<p>During this sprint we have simplified the unit files for Tumbleweed and SLE, as you can see in <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/pull/332/files">this pull request</a>. It&#8217;s a small change but with a huge impact and several implications, so a lot of time was invested into testing during the sprint. The problems seem to be gone, but more AutoYaST and YaST-Firstboot testing would be highly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Many other things</h3>
<p>As usual, this is only a brief collection of highlights of all the job done during the sprint. Using Scrum terminology, this represents only 27 story points out of a total of 81 story points delivered by the team during this sprint. Using more mundane words, this is just a third part of what we have achieved during the last three weeks.</p>
<p>Hopefully, enough to keep you entertained until the next report in other three weeks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some time back I wrote a patch to KIWI that allows running openSUSE live entirely from RAM(tmpfs).<br />
<span id="more-11671"></span></p>
<p>How to use it?<br />
Pass &#8220;toram&#8221; parameter at the boot menu. Try it on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits:<br />
Running the OS from RAM make it lot more responsive than running from DVD or USB device, for example it is most useful for running a demo computer where many users try lot of applications installed in the live system. USB or the DVD can be ejected once the OS is loaded. It can be used to load OS to RAM directly from iso in a virtual machine as well.</p>
<p>Caveat:<br />
Needs enough RAM to copy the entire iso to RAM and then some spare to operate the OS, Li-f-e for instance would need minimum 5G RAM available. It also takes a bit longer to boot as the entire image is copied to RAM.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
You&#8217;ve certainly noticed that I didn&#8217;t run for a second turn, after my first 2 years. This doesn&#8217;t mean the election time and the actual campaign are boring <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
<br />If you are an openSUSE Member, we really want to have your vote, so go to <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election">Board Election Wiki</a> and make your own opinion.<br />
<br />The ballot should open tomorrow.
</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/board-leaving-tigerfoot.png" alt="board-leaving-tigerfoot" width="370" height="262" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11655" style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px" srcset="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/board-leaving-tigerfoot-300x212.png 300w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/board-leaving-tigerfoot.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<h3>Why not a second turn?</h3>
<p>Being a board member (present at almost every conference call, reading the mailing lists and other task) consume free time. It has increased during the last semester too. And we&#8217;ve got some new business opportunities here at Ioda-Net Sàrl in 2015, and those need also my attention for the next year(s). I prefer to be a retired Board member, than not being able to handle my responsabilities.<br />
But I&#8217;m not against the idea of a <i>&quot;I&#8217;ll be back&quot;</i> in a near future. Moreover with a bit more bandwidth in my free time, I will be able to continue my packaging stuff, and other contributions.
</p>
<h3 style="clear:both">What a journey!</h3>
<p>With the new campaign running, I found funny to bring back to light my <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_platform_2013_tigerfoot">2013 platform</a> written 2 years ago. And spent 5 minutes on checking the differences with today. I&#8217;m inviting you to discover the small interview between me and myself <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>
<h4>1. Which sentences would you say again today?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a &quot;Fucking Green Dreamer&quot; of a world of collaboration, which will one day offer Freedom for everyone.<br />
<br />Clearly still a day by day mantra and leitmotiv. But even if I&#8217;m dreaming, I never forget that<br />
<b>Freedom has a price : Freedom will only be what you do for it.</b>
</p>
<p><span id="more-11647"></span></p>
<h4>2. Which thing you would not say again, or differently ?</h4>
<p>Well, as there&#8217;s no joker card, let&#8217;s start by this one:<br />
&quot;A Visible Active Board &gt; A Visible Active Project.&quot; With the experience and time, and interaction, (the one who said fight, get out please :-)), I would said this is not as easy as it sound first.<br />
I&#8217;m pretty sure, I was more quieter since I was on the board, than before. Because it&#8217;s too hard to make a clear distinction, when you just want to express something as &quot;a simple contributor&quot;: you are on the board, and then whatever you can try to trick the fact: you&#8217;re still a board member.<br />
<br />So making the Board visible like a kind of communicant Alien, will certainly not improve that much our project.<br />
It&#8217;s written everywhere, almost everybody agree, the board is not the lighthouse in the dark showing you the future.<br />
Anyone, I repeat, anyone in this community is a potential vector of a future for openSUSE.
</p>
<p>So in my past platform &quot;Guardians of the past, Managers of the present, Creators of the future.&quot; I would replace Creators of the future by kinda &quot;enabler&quot;</p>
<h4>3. In the last 2 years, where did openSUSE mostly evolve?</h4>
<p>I think we moved from a traditional way of building distribution to some creative alternative, the rolling but tested Tumbleweed, and the hybrid Leap are really good things that happened.<br />
I believe that if we have also some hard time on mailing list, which are exhausting, they also have a positive aspect (yeap:-)). If we fight, then it&#8217;s certainly because of our faith in something. Is this one defined? Not sure! But I&#8217;m pretty convinced that all members around have a good image of it.
</p>
<h4>4. What would be an advice to your successor (even if he doesn&#8217;t care about it)?</h4>
<p>We are a tooling community, we love tools. Beware of one thing, if you get hurt by a tool, you can become the worst asshole you&#8217;ve never met. With tools, you can also hurt other people.
</p>
<p>My advise, watch your step and keystroke!</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/truly-green-yours.png" alt="truly-green-yours" width="230" height="217" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11667" style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px" /></p>
<h4>5. Something more you would like to share?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve invested time and energy during 2014 and beginning of 2015, to run booth, talks, represent openSUSE&#8217;s project all around. It was awesome to go to those events and meet people, involved or interested about openSUSE.<br />
<br /> Perhaps some of you don&#8217;t know, but we have friends all around us, in many communities, and when the magic about working together appears, it just blast my heart.
</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and for your support during this period</p>
<p><b>Truly green yours</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised in the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2015/12/15/lets-blog-about-yast/">previous post</a> on this blog, we&#8217;ll try to keep you updated about what is happening in the YaST world. Before Christmas we finished an specially short sprint, interrupted by <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek">another successful Hackweek</a>. Although we always reserve some time for bug fixing, the last two sprints has been quite focused in looking into the future, implementing new solutions for old problems and trying to prepare replacements for some legacy stuff we have been carrying on for too long. Here you are the highlights.</p>
<h3>SCR replacement</h3>
<p>For low level access to the system, YaST uses its own library called SCR, inherited from the old YCP days. It&#8217;s used to call scripts and also to read and write files. Its design is showing its age and using it from Ruby is unnecessary complex. We feel SCR is one of the biggest source of confusion for newcomers to YaST development. Last but not least, SCR is only used by YaST which means all the maintenance work fall to us.</p>
<p>We want to use a new approach for the future. For running scripts we plan to use a Ruby gem called <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/cheetah">Cheetah</a> and for accessing configuration files we plan to rely on <a href="http://augeas.net/">Augeas</a>.</p>
<p>Taking some improvements that were needed in YaST2-Bootloader and the drop of perl-bootloader as starting points (or as an excuse, if you prefer), we have used this sprint to develop all the moving parts that will allow us to easily use Cheetah and Augeas within YaST.</p>
<p>For Cheetah, we have contributed two features to the upstream project: <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/cheetah/pull/33">chroot support</a> and the ability to provide <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/cheetah/pull/32">environment variables</a>.</p>
<p>For Augeas we have developed an object oriented layer called <a href="https://github.com/config-files-api/config_files_api">Config Files Api</a> (shortly CFA). The idea of CFA is to provide specific functionality by mean of plugins. Of course, the <a href="https://github.com/config-files-api/config_files_api_grub2">first plugin</a> we have developed is aimed to manipulation of all the Grub2 configuration files.</p>
<p>The next step will be to integrate these new components into the next versions of YaST2-Bootloader, hitting your Tumbleweed repositories soon. Of course, after all the usual manual and openQA testing.</p>
<h3>Libstorage replacement</h3>
<p>Another low level layer that has been a constant source of headache for YaST developers is libstorage. We use it -specially in the installer and the partitioner- to access disks, partitions, volumes and all that. Once again, the original design have fundamental flaws that limit us in many ways and we have been dreaming for quite some time about writing a replacement for it.</p>
<p>To make this rewrite fit into the Scrum process, we are using the new redesigned library (find the code <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage-bgl-eval">at Github</a> and the packages <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:aschnell:storage-redesign/libstorage">at OBS</a>) to write prototypes for the installer partitioning proposal and for a new partitioning YaST module.</p>
<p>This new module is only intended as a testbed to showcase the development of the new library and to drive its integration process. It&#8217;s not intended for end users, but after this sprint it can already do some things that are impossible with the current partitioner and even shows some nice graphs really useful for debugging and verifying the behavior of the library.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/action-graph.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/action-graph-300x219.png" alt="Libstorage Tech Preview: action graph" width="300" height="219" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11634" srcset="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/action-graph-300x219.png 300w, http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/action-graph.png 816w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t mind to break your system using unsupported software, you can always fetch <a href="https://github.com/aschnell/yast-storage-ng">the code</a> or <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:aschnell:storage-redesign/yast2-storage-ng">the packages</a>.</p>
<h3>AutoYaST integration tests</h3>
<p>Testing is crucial in software development. And integration tests are a must when you are developing an installer. During the last sprints, we have been developing and improving our own solution for testing AutoYaST-driven installations, consisting on a set of tests and a framework to run them.</p>
<p>The goal for this sprint was to de-couple the tests and the framework. Making it possible to reuse our tests in openQA. As a side effect, we wanted to ease the installation and usage of our testing framework.</p>
<p>Both goals were achieved, now you can install AutoYaST Integration Tests (not a very original name) following <a href="https://github.com/yast/autoyast-integration-test">the instructions</a> available in the repository and there is already an openQA instance directly running <a href="https://github.com/yast/aytests-tests">the separately available tests</a>.</p>

<h3>Snapper development documentation</h3>
<p>Last but not least, as a side effect of the development (and the Scrum principles), we have improved the Snapper&#8217;s development documentation. Enjoy it at <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper">the usual Snapper repository</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all folks. Next sprint starts next week and will be three weeks long, so expect more news during the first days of February.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier tool <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/">live-fat-stick</a> uses syslinux to create multiboot USB stick/hdd on a vfat parition without having to format the stick preserving existing data and copying whole ISO so the same stick can serve as demo as well as to copy ISOs for distributing. However the disadvantages are all of them that comes from using vfat.</p>
<p>Grub2 has come a long way and almost all major distributions now support booting from the iso image via loopback. So here is <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/live-grub-stick">live-grub-stick</a> script that uses grub in place of syslinux bringing in all the advantages of using grub2.</p>
<p>Currently live images of openSUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora and all their clones are supported. Go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/cyberorg/live-fat-stick">fork it</a> if you would like to add support for your distribution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best Linux distribution for education got a whole lot better, your <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e(Linux for Education)</a> takes a &#8220;<a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2015/11/04/opensuse-leap-42-1-becomes-first-hybrid-distribution/">Leap</a>&#8221; to 42.1. <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Education">openSUSE Education</a> community is proud to present this latest edition based on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.1">openSUSE 42.1</a> with all the features, updates and bug fixes available on it till date. This effectively makes it the only enterprise grade long term supported(LTS) distribution for Education.</p>
<p>As with previous releases <a href="http://download.opensuse-education.org/~cyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-4211-packages.txt">we have bundled a ton of softwares</a> on this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick">live DVD/USB</a> specially packaged for education, along with the Plasma, GNOME and Mate Desktop Environments, full multimedia experience is also provided out of the box thanks to the Packman repositories. Only x86_64 architecture is supported, if you have a lot of machines that only support x86 then read on to find out how you can extend their Li-f-e.<br />
<span id="more-11596"></span></p>
<p>You can of course very <a href="http://cyberorg.github.io/kiwi-ltsp-howto/">easily turn Li-f-e to full-fledged LTSP server</a> to PXE boot machines in your local network. Booting both i686 and x86_64 architectures is supported. In case you need to PXE boot machines below i686 then you would have to <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc">install this package</a>.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>
