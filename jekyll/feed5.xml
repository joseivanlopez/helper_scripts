				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised in the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2015/12/15/lets-blog-about-yast/">previous post</a> on this blog, we&#8217;ll try to keep you updated about what is happening in the YaST world. Before Christmas we finished an specially short sprint, interrupted by <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek">another successful Hackweek</a>. Although we always reserve some time for bug fixing, the last two sprints has been quite focused in looking into the future, implementing new solutions for old problems and trying to prepare replacements for some legacy stuff we have been carrying on for too long. Here you are the highlights.</p>
<h3>SCR replacement</h3>
<p>For low level access to the system, YaST uses its own library called SCR, inherited from the old YCP days. It&#8217;s used to call scripts and also to read and write files. Its design is showing its age and using it from Ruby is unnecessary complex. We feel SCR is one of the biggest source of confusion for newcomers to YaST development. Last but not least, SCR is only used by YaST which means all the maintenance work fall to us.</p>
<p>We want to use a new approach for the future. For running scripts we plan to use a Ruby gem called <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/cheetah">Cheetah</a> and for accessing configuration files we plan to rely on <a href="http://augeas.net/">Augeas</a>.</p>
<p>Taking some improvements that were needed in YaST2-Bootloader and the drop of perl-bootloader as starting points (or as an excuse, if you prefer), we have used this sprint to develop all the moving parts that will allow us to easily use Cheetah and Augeas within YaST.</p>
<p>For Cheetah, we have contributed two features to the upstream project: <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/cheetah/pull/33">chroot support</a> and the ability to provide <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/cheetah/pull/32">environment variables</a>.</p>
<p>For Augeas we have developed an object oriented layer called <a href="https://github.com/config-files-api/config_files_api">Config Files Api</a> (shortly CFA). The idea of CFA is to provide specific functionality by mean of plugins. Of course, the <a href="https://github.com/config-files-api/config_files_api_grub2">first plugin</a> we have developed is aimed to manipulation of all the Grub2 configuration files.</p>
<p>The next step will be to integrate these new components into the next versions of YaST2-Bootloader, hitting your Tumbleweed repositories soon. Of course, after all the usual manual and openQA testing.</p>
<h3>Libstorage replacement</h3>
<p>Another low level layer that has been a constant source of headache for YaST developers is libstorage. We use it -specially in the installer and the partitioner- to access disks, partitions, volumes and all that. Once again, the original design have fundamental flaws that limit us in many ways and we have been dreaming for quite some time about writing a replacement for it.</p>
<p>To make this rewrite fit into the Scrum process, we are using the new redesigned library (find the code <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage-bgl-eval">at Github</a> and the packages <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:aschnell:storage-redesign/libstorage">at OBS</a>) to write prototypes for the installer partitioning proposal and for a new partitioning YaST module.</p>
<p>This new module is only intended as a testbed to showcase the development of the new library and to drive its integration process. It&#8217;s not intended for end users, but after this sprint it can already do some things that are impossible with the current partitioner and even shows some nice graphs really useful for debugging and verifying the behavior of the library.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/action-graph.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/action-graph-300x219.png" alt="Libstorage Tech Preview: action graph" width="300" height="219" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11634" /></a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t mind to break your system using unsupported software, you can always fetch <a href="https://github.com/aschnell/yast-storage-ng">the code</a> or <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:aschnell:storage-redesign/yast2-storage-ng">the packages</a>.</p>
<h3>AutoYaST integration tests</h3>
<p>Testing is crucial in software development. And integration tests are a must when you are developing an installer. During the last sprints, we have been developing and improving our own solution for testing AutoYaST-driven installations, consisting on a set of tests and a framework to run them.</p>
<p>The goal for this sprint was to de-couple the tests and the framework. Making it possible to reuse our tests in openQA. As a side effect, we wanted to ease the installation and usage of our testing framework.</p>
<p>Both goals were achieved, now you can install AutoYaST Integration Tests (not a very original name) following <a href="https://github.com/yast/autoyast-integration-test">the instructions</a> available in the repository and there is already an openQA instance directly running <a href="https://github.com/yast/aytests-tests">the separately available tests</a>.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/aytests-help.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/aytests-help-300x78.png" alt="aytests-help" width="300" height="78" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11639" /></a></p>
<h3>Snapper development documentation</h3>
<p>Last but not least, as a side effect of the development (and the Scrum principles), we have improved the Snapper&#8217;s development documentation. Enjoy it at <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper">the usual Snapper repository</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all folks. Next sprint starts next week and will be three weeks long, so expect more news during the first days of February.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier tool <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/">live-fat-stick</a> uses syslinux to create multiboot USB stick/hdd on a vfat parition without having to format the stick preserving existing data and copying whole ISO so the same stick can serve as demo as well as to copy ISOs for distributing. However the disadvantages are all of them that comes from using vfat.</p>
<p>Grub2 has come a long way and almost all major distributions now support booting from the iso image via loopback. So here is <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/live-grub-stick">live-grub-stick</a> script that uses grub in place of syslinux bringing in all the advantages of using grub2.</p>
<p>Currently live images of openSUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora and all their clones are supported. Go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/cyberorg/live-fat-stick">fork it</a> if you would like to add support for your distribution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best Linux distribution for education got a whole lot better, your <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e(Linux for Education)</a> takes a &#8220;<a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2015/11/04/opensuse-leap-42-1-becomes-first-hybrid-distribution/">Leap</a>&#8221; to 42.1. <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Education">openSUSE Education</a> community is proud to present this latest edition based on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.1">openSUSE 42.1</a> with all the features, updates and bug fixes available on it till date. This effectively makes it the only enterprise grade long term supported(LTS) distribution for Education.</p>
<p>As with previous releases <a href="http://download.opensuse-education.org/~cyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-4211-packages.txt">we have bundled a ton of softwares</a> on this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick">live DVD/USB</a> specially packaged for education, along with the Plasma, GNOME and Mate Desktop Environments, full multimedia experience is also provided out of the box thanks to the Packman repositories. Only x86_64 architecture is supported, if you have a lot of machines that only support x86 then read on to find out how you can extend their Li-f-e.<br />
<span id="more-11596"></span></p>
<p>You can of course very <a href="http://cyberorg.github.io/kiwi-ltsp-howto/">easily turn Li-f-e to full-fledged LTSP server</a> to PXE boot machines in your local network. Booting both i686 and x86_64 architectures is supported. In case you need to PXE boot machines below i686 then you would have to <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc">install this package</a>.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since some months ago, the YaST Team at SUSE has been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> to organize the work. Among other things, that means the whole team takes part in a review meeting every three weeks to showcase the fixed bugs and the implemented features. To support those review meetings we often create screenshots, text summaries, short videos and other material. Is it not a pity that all that content get unnoticed for curious users and potential contributors?</p>
<p>In order to give the SUSE and openSUSE communities an opportunity to lurk into those review meetings, we have decided to create this team blog and post here the highlights after every meeting. Not all the fixes and features will be covered, but we&#8217;ll try to blog about the most exciting or relevant changes.</p>
<p>Obviously, many of those posts will be more exciting for developers and Tumbleweed users than for users of the stable release (bugfixes tend to be unexciting). But, as some kind of bonus track, Leap 42.1 users can always revisit the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Features#openSUSE_technologies">summary of what the recent release brought</a> to the YaST (and friends) world.</p>
<p>The current sprint ends right before Christmas, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>It seems since the release, that a number of report of broken xorg with gdm, ssdm and so&#8230; segfaulting</p>
<p>You can still use the previous version hanging on the server. But I doubt it would work better</p>
<p>As soon, with Sebastian Siebert we have a patch for, I will republish a new build</p>

<p>If you have any problems with the driver, don&#8217;t be afraid to report to Sebastian (German and English bugreports are gladly accepted).<br />
he will try, as far as I am able to reproduce the bug. Together with the necessary system information, he will go directly to the right place at AMD to have the bug fixed in the next driver release.<br />
Thank you very much, Sebastian.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMD has released the new AMD Catalyst 15.11 (Radeon Crimson Edition). My script replaces the existing packaging script with an updated packaging script. It supports up to Kernel 4.4. (Official support up to Kernel 3.19)</p>
<p>I have adapted the AMD driver to the Kernel 4.4 (rc3). For the moment it works for Kernel 4.4-rc3. Unfortunately the AMD driver has a compatibility issue in combination with the GNOME Desktopmanager and X-Server. As a workaround, I recommend for GNOME another Desktopmanager such as lightdm until the issue is hopefully fixed.</p>
<p>Resolved Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>[SWDEV-55204] Stuttering when running glxgears with VSync enabled</li>
<li>[SWDEV-7339] Intermittent mouse cursor corruption</li>
</ul>

<p>Bruno Friedmann will build the new RPM packages in the fglrx repository. Stay tune!</p>
<p>If you find any issue with the driver. Don’t hesitate to contact me. I am in contact with AMD and can forward your issue to the right place. Feedback are welcome.</p>
<p>A report of your system is very helpful beside your feedback. You can generate it with the script:<br />
<code>su -c 'sh makerpm-amd-15.11.sh -ur'</code></p>
<p>Have a lot of fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up from my earlier post about <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2014/12/16/ltsp-client-goes-banana-pi/">openSUSE LTSP on Banana Pi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102091635847832058268">Nora Lee</a> from the manufacturer of the board got in touch with me and sent me a couple of their new boards- <a href="http://www.bananapi.com/index.php/component/content/article?layout=edit&amp;id=73">Banana Pi M2,</a> runs on A31s quad-core CPU and has 1G RAM, powerful enough to run openSUSE Tumbleweed with Xfce Desktop.</p>
<p>Here is how you can get openSUSE running on Banana Pi M2.</p>
<p>* <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/opensuse-arm/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.tar.xz/download">Download the image</a></p>
<p>* Extract the archive to get openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img</p>
<p>* Dump openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img on to a SD card<br />
(dd if=/path/to/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M; sync #replace /dev/sdX with your actual SD card device)</p>
<p>*  In case you have a bigger SD card, use yast2 disk(partitioner) to &#8220;expand&#8221; the second partition. You can use yast’s package manager to install more software. The default password for root is <strong>linux</strong>, you may want to change that first thing after booting.</p>
<p>I am unable to get sound on this hardware, probably <a href="https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-Mainline-bsp">their kernel</a> is missing sound related modules, if you figure out how to get sound working drop me a line so I can include it in next release.Everything else(wifi, hdmi out, USB ports etc) works well enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No.. I haven&#8217;t forget you! I think of you every day, night and if I&#8217;m honest all the time. You and you and you and especially you who are reading these lines. This is going to be sort blog entry. I want you to know what you should start doing! Yes just stop being social in internet. Get out of your comfort zone and start <del>spank the monkey</del> (oh.. sorry not spank the monkey this is children approved blog..) er.. learning new stuff.<span id="more-11569"></span></p>
<p>Start you maker project and learn how to 3D with <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> (it&#8217;s marvelous 3D application). After Blender there is no excuse and it&#8217;s free (but remember if you really like it give something back). Are you on more on CAD? Learn 3D CAD with <a href="http://freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a> (Again amazing tool). Want to ride IoT wave but you don&#8217;t have too much money then get new shiny <a href="http://linuxgizmos.com/tiny-5-dollar-raspberry-pi-zero-keeps-it-simple/">Tiny $5 Raspberry Pi Zero</a> or <a href="http://nextthing.co/">9$ C.H.I.P</a> and make your <a href="http://fritzing.org">Fritzing</a> electric boogie with ease (and by the way you can commit those boards to library. It&#8217;s open source!). You are in music how about doing some DJ:n with linux? <a href="http://mixxx.org/">Mixxx</a> just got shiny 2.0 RC1 out. Are you more reading type and need something to manage you e-books: <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> is here to help. Huh so much to do so less time!</p>
<p>Where to get them? openSUSE have RPM for all of them just learn to search them from Packman or from <a href="https://build.opensuse.org">OBS</a>. Sorry to say Raspberry Pi <em>Zero is currently not supported but you can help to add it</em> to ARM boards working with openSUSE same problems with C.H.I.P (If you have Raspberry Pi 1/2 just get image for them from openSUSE ARM image and start hacking). You should learn how to add new repos to YaST2 and add <a href="http://packman.links2linux.de/">Packman</a> repo for new FreeCAD, Fritzing and Mixxx. Yes! most of them run also on Windows and Mac OS X. Now smile on, thumbs up and <strong>get your groove on</strong> with title song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxEu4uf0-b8">De La Soul &#8211; Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)</a></p>

<p>The 8th Free and Open Source Software Communities Meeting (<a href="http://fosscomm.teiath.gr/" target="_blank">FOSSCOMM</a>) took place in Athens (Greece), November 6-8th 2015 at the <a href="http://www.teiath.gr/articles.php?id=98&amp;lang=el" target="_blank">Technical Educational Institute of Athens</a>.</p>
<p>The Conference started early on Saturday morning welcoming the participants and with the key note. Various presentations about open source software, hardware constructions and some workshops took place. Presentations such as Raspberry Pi arcade, openstack, OSGeo, ownCloud, Bitcoin and many more were quite interested by the visitors.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0716" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eiosifidis/22316436533/in/album-72157660299594107/"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/670/22316436533_ee99406122_n.jpg" alt="DSC_0716" width="320" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>Greek openSUSE community was there with a booth and some presentations. On Saturday Alex P. Natsios presented “Enlightment on openSUSE”, an alternative GUI, and the other presentation was about “openQA”. Since openSUSE Leap 42.1 was very fresh, Alexandros Vennos took the opportunity to present what are openSUSE Leap 42.1 and Tumbleweed, the differences and what to install on what occasions. Presentation had title “openSUSE – Leaping Ahead”.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0709" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eiosifidis/22911595656/in/album-72157660299594107/"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5644/22911595656_3e32100290_n.jpg" alt="DSC_0709" width="320" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>The booth was quite crowded. We had some left over DVDs of 13.2 but we proposed the visitors to install Leap 42.1. The question we were asked most was what is the difference between openSUSE Leap and Tubleweed and why to install and on what ocasion. We even created couple of bootable USBs from the ISOs of Leap. We had a Banana Pi running Tumbleweed with MATE playing a video loop of openSUSE Leap 42.1 KDE review. We gave almost all of our promo materials to the visitors since they were interested on openSUSE.</p>
